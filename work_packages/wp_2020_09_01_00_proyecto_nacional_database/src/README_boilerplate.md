All files here should be bash scripts that launches containers to do
some work, evaluating and executing scripts present at the **scripts**
folder. Most probably they will mount the .. folder to access the
**data** one.

Check for **docker-data-science-scripts** at **dev-miscellaneous**.

Scripts here are meant to be run at the **DOCKER HOST**.
